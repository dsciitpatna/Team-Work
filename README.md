# Watch Web App

Watch Web App is solution to the issue that a person might not complete his duties on time and with complete dedication after he is assigned a responsibility.
This would involve creating a platform where several tasks can be queued for a person by the committee head. If the person fails to do so, his rating would drop among his peers. This would impact his work profile as actual nature and work would be ported in the public domain. 
To scale it up it could be used in commercial organizations to monitor work and efficiency of employees.
